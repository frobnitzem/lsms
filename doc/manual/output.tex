\chapter{Output Files}

\LSMS\ can generate different output files to provide information about the progress of the calculation and about physical properties of the whole system and on an per atomic site basis.
The \texttt{k.out} file shows the convergence progress of a self-consistent calculation.. The main per atom information can be found in the \texttt{info\_evec\_out} file that is written at the end of a \LSMS\ job execution.

\section{\texttt{k.out}}
The \texttt{k.out} file tracks the convergence progress of a \LSMS\ calculation. It is updated at every iteration step and the last line contains the information about the most recently concluded step.
This file contains five columns with the following information:
\begin{enumerate}
\item iteration number
\item total energy of the system in Rydberg units.
\item Fermi energy
\item the magnetic moment of atomic site 1
\item RMS error (convergence parameter)
\end{enumerate}

\section{\texttt{info\_evec\_out}}
\subsection{Line 1}
The first line of \texttt{info\_evec\_out} has three columns and lists
\begin{enumerate}
\item total energy
\item band energy
\item Fermi energy
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Per Atom Lines}
The rest of \texttt{info\_evec\_out} , beginning with the second line, contains one line for each site in the system.
Each line has 18 columns with the following information:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Atomic number
\item Site index (starting with 0 for the first site)
\item $x$ component of the site coordinate
\item $y$ component of the site coordinate
\item $z$ component of the site coordinate
\item electron charge associated with this site (note that the electron charge is counted here with a positive sign)
\item magnetic moment associated with this site in $\mu_B$
\item $x$ component of the magnetic moment direction
\item $y$ component of the magnetic moment direction
\item $z$ component of the magnetic moment direction
\item site dependent magnetic moment dirrection mixing parameter (Currently always $-1$)
\item $x$ component of the magnetic constraining field
\item $y$ component of the magnetic constraining field
\item $z$ component of the magnetic constraining field
\item shift of spin-up and spin-down potential
\item $x$ component of the new magnetic moment direction
\item $y$ component of the new magnetic moment direction
\item $z$ component of the new magnetic moment direction 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Local Atom Data File}
if the input files specifies a filename for \texttt{localAtomData} this file is writen in a format similar to \texttt{info\_evec\_out}, but with somewhat different contents.
\subsection{Line 1}
The first line has four columns and lists
\begin{enumerate}
\item total energy
\item band energy
\item Fermi energy
\item electrostatic energy
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Per Atom Lines}
The rest of the local atom data file, beginning with the second line, contains one line for each site in the system.
Each line has 16 columns with the following information:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Atomic number
\item Site index (starting with 0 for the first site)
\item $x$ component of the site coordinate
\item $y$ component of the site coordinate
\item $z$ component of the site coordinate
\item electron charge associated with this site (note that the electron charge is counted here with a positive sign)
\item magnetic moment associated with this site in $\mu_B$
\item $x$ component of the magnetic moment direction
\item $y$ component of the magnetic moment direction
\item $z$ component of the magnetic moment direction
\item $x$ component of the magnetic constraining field
\item $y$ component of the magnetic constraining field
\item $z$ component of the magnetic constraining field
\item shift of spin-up and spin-down potential
\item local site volume (in units of ${a_0}^3$)
\item local site energy
\end{enumerate}
